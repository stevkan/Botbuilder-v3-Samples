     "1": "Thanks for the helpful information <name>! I’m sorry you are facing this issue with your healthcare.",
     "2": "So, there is a chance your doctor performs this type of service regularly and he or she is speaking generally because health plans often deny it. Or, your doctor’s office may have received a denial from your health plan after submitting a prior authorization for the service or treatment.",
     "3": "This approval is a process where your doctor requests and your health plan agrees that the prescribed service or medication is one you need. If the prior authorization is denied, you may be entitled to a peer to peer review of your case. This review is a meeting, most often a phone conversation, between a doctor at your insurance company and your treating doctor.",
     "4": "Getting the two doctors on the phone is a good thing because your doctor can better explain the reasoning for ordering the services as well as give extra details about your case. Sometimes the decision can be reversed at this stage.",
     "5": "If a peer to peer review is not available, or if it is unsuccessful, you have the option of moving forward with the formal appeals process.",
     "6": "If your doctor strongly believes the service is critical to your health, ask the billing coordinator if the office will work with you on the cost, aware that you will be without support of your insurer. The office can still file a claim with your health plan after you have the service and if denied, you can move forward and file an appeal.",
     "Prompt": "Would you like to hear more about the appeals process?",

          "Yes",
