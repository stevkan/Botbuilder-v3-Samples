{
     "1": "<name>, thanks for the information. I’m sorry to hear that you are facing this challenge with your healthcare. I understand that your doctor has prescribed a service or treatment for you that your health plan has denied because they consider it experimental or investigational.",
     "2": "You should have the right to appeal. Being timely is important so pay attention to the letter’s deadline for submission.",
     "3": "Basically, a denial is a contract dispute. In your case the insurance company considers the service your doctor is requesting for you to be experimental or investigational. A service is considered this when it is not FDA approved, or if there is lacking medical or scientific evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of it.",
     "4": "However, this does not mean that it is not safe or effective in your situation. It just means if you go ahead and have the service, your health plan may not cover the charges.",
     "5": "Review your denial letter carefully as it outlines your next steps for appealing the decision. You may be entitled to a peer to peer review of your case. This review is a meeting, most often a phone conversation, between a doctor at your insurance company and your treating doctor.",
     "6": "Getting the two doctors on the phone is a good thing because your doctor can better explain the reasoning for ordering the services as well as give extra details about your case. Sometimes the denial can be overturned without having to go forward with the formal appeals process.",
     "7": "If a peer to peer review is not available, or if it is denied, you have the option of moving forward with the formal appeals process.",
     "Prompt": "Do you want to hear more about appealing the denial?",
     "Choices": [
          "Yes",
          "No"
