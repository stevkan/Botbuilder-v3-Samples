     "1": "I’m sorry to hear you are facing this issue with your healthcare. There could be a lot of reasons that your insurance company isn’t covering your medication.",
     "2": "Start by calling your health plan to get more information on why the medication wasn’t covered. Also, reach out to your doctor’s office to let them know what’s going on. They may be able to offer some guidance on how to best move forward.",
     "3": "Even if you believe you have met your plan’s deductible, it might be a good idea to double check. Some plans provide drug coverage before you meet your deductible, some only offer it after you have met it, and some have a separate deductible altogether for medications. These deductibles are separate (and generally a lot lower) than your overall deductible for other medical care. Once you’ve paid out your prescription deductible your drugs may be covered with a copayment.",
     "4": "There is a chance your medication could be on a high tier. The listing of medications your health plan covers is called a formulary. The medications on that formulary are broken into tiers. Your medication could be on a high tier where you are responsible for a higher rate than your other medications. But, you or your doctor can request a tier exception from your health plan. This would mean you could obtain a high tier drug at the lower cost applicable to drugs in a lower tier.",
     "5": "Yet, there could still be other reasons your insurance company isn’t covering your medication. The cost may be high because your health plan has denied it. That could be because the medication might not be on the list of covered medications called a formulary, because they require you to try other medications before paying for this one, or maybe because your plan only covers generic medications.",
     "6": "Depending on the situation, your doctor may be able to prescribe another cheaper medication that would meet your health plan’s requirements and would be just as effective for you.",
     "7": "You go have the option to go ahead and purchase the medication without your insurance paying, and there may actually be some assistance available through a special program or a discount card. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about any medication assistance programs to help lower the cost if you choose to go this route.",
