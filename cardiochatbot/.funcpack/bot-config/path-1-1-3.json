I understand that your doctor has prescribed a service or treatment for you that your health plan is not paying for because they do not have a pre-authorization or pre-approval on file for the service you received.",

     "3": "As frustrating as it might seem, your situation is not uncommon. There are many reasons this could happen.",
     "4": "The first step in this situation is to contact your health plan to see if they allow your doctor to request a retroactive prior authorization. If your health plan allows it, your doctor’s office would submit a request for the services as if you had not already had them.",
     "5": "Some health plans do not permit doctors to file retroactive authorizations. If that is the case, you should have the option to proceed with the appeals process.",
     "Prompt": "Would you like to find out more about the appeals process?",
